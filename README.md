# Boat_Localisation

## Project description

Assume you are out fishing on a lake (or in an archipelago), whatever floats your goat. After an intense morning of battling the beasts of the deep you take a nap in the boat. You wake up several hours later, completely disoriented. You can safely assume that you have drifted around *quite* a lot. Whatâ€™s even more troubling is that a think fog has settled over the water. You approximate the visibility to about five meters. Consequently, you have no idea where you are. Looking around in your boat, you find the following objects:

* One topological map of the lake (or archipelago).
* One laptop running your favourite IDE and programming language, with all the slickest libraries dowloaded.
